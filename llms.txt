# Ray.Di

> Ray.Di is a PHP dependency injection framework inspired by Google Guice. It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage dependencies in your PHP applications through constructor injection, setter injection, and assisted injection.

Ray.Di is a mature framework that has been actively maintained since 2015, supporting the latest PHP versions while maintaining backward compatibility. It follows the dependency injection pattern to create loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable code.

## Core Concepts

- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected from outside rather than created internally
- **Modules**: Configuration units that define how dependencies are resolved
- **Bindings**: Map interfaces to their implementations
- **Scopes**: Control the lifecycle of injected objects (Singleton, Prototype)
- **AOP Support**: Aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns

## Key Features

- Constructor injection without annotations
- Method injection with #[Inject] attribute
- Assisted injection for runtime dependencies
- Provider pattern support for lazy loading
- Contextual bindings for different implementations
- Built-in AOP support for method interception
- Multi-bindings for plugin architectures
