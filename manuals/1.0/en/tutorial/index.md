## üõí Case Study: E-commerce Platform

Throughout this tutorial, we'll build **"ShopSmart"** - a complete e-commerce platform featuring:

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profiles
- **Product Catalog**: Categories, inventory, search
- **Order Processing**: Cart, checkout, payment
- **Administration**: Analytics, reporting, management
- **Infrastructure**: Caching, logging, monitoring

This real-world example demonstrates how Ray.Di enables:
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Easy unit and integration testing  
- **Maintainability**: Loose coupling and high cohesion
- **Scalability**: Proper scope management and performance
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture and interceptors

## üîß Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- Basic understanding of OOP concepts
- Familiarity with interfaces and abstract classes

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the tutorial examples
git clone https://github.com/ray-di/tutorial-examples.git
cd tutorial-examples

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run the first example
php examples/01-basics/hello-world.php
```

## üìñ Code Examples

All examples are:
- **Runnable**: Complete, working code
- **Progressive**: Building complexity step by step
- **Practical**: Based on real-world scenarios
- **Well-documented**: Extensive comments and explanations

## üéØ Key Concepts Covered

### Dependency Injection Patterns
- Constructor Injection
- Method Injection  
- Property Injection
- Interface Segregation

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: One reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: No forced dependencies on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Ray.Di Features
- **Binding DSL**: Fluent configuration API
- **Scopes**: Singleton, prototype, request, session
- **Providers**: Factory patterns and lazy initialization
- **Interceptors**: AOP for cross-cutting concerns
- **Multibindings**: Sets and maps of implementations
- **Conditional Bindings**: Environment-specific configuration

### Software Architecture Patterns
- **Layered Architecture**: Presentation, business, data
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic coordination
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation strategies
- **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven programming
- **Decorator Pattern**: Behavior enhancement

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Run the Code**: Don't just read - execute the examples
2. **Experiment**: Modify examples to see different behaviors
3. **Ask Questions**: Check issues or discussions for help
4. **Practice**: Build your own examples using the patterns
5. **Review**: Come back to concepts as you gain experience
