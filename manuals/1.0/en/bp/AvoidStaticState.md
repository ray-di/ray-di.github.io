# Avoid static state

Static state and testability are enemies. Your tests should be fast and free of
side-effects. But non-constant values held by static fields are a pain to
manage. It's tricky to reliably tear down static singletons that are mocked by
tests, and this interferes with other tests.

Although *static state* is bad, there's nothing wrong with the static *keyword*.
Static classes are okay (preferred even!) and for pure functions (sorting, math,
etc.), static is just fine.
